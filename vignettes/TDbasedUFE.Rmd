# Introduction

TDbasedUFE is a R package that intends to perform various abalyses using
Tensor decomposition based unsupervised feature extraction (TDbasedUFE) 
[@Taguchi2020]
as much as possible in an user friendly manner. 
Although in the future, I am planning to implement all the features possible 
by TDbasedUFE in this R package, at the moment, it includes only basic features.
